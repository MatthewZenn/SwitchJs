# SwitchJs
A JavaScript console emulator, intended for experimenting with the Nintendo Switch Console.

This project was inspired by [JsConsole.com](https://www.jsconsole.com)

## *Setup*

- Locally host the project through whatever service you choose: (Node, Python, VScode, etc)
- Open your Switch's network settings and manually set your Primary DNS to ```045.055.142.122```
- If the SwitchBru channel doesn't open automatically: return to the Home Screen, open the News App, and click "Add Channel"
- Once on switchBru, you can go to the IPaddress of your host
- Enjoy the javascript console running on a Nintendo Switch
